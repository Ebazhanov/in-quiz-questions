Scala Assessment
-------------

#### Q1. Scala bytecode can run on top of Java VM. What is the fundamental difference between Java object.clone() and Scala object.copy()?

- [ ] One is a Java object, the other is a Scala object.
- [ ] clone() will copy class structures but not the data, while copy() will also copy data into new objects.
- [ ] There is no difference.
- [ ] copy() allows you to change values during the copying process; clone() does not.


#### Q2. What value does this code return? 

```
val m1 = Map("a"->1,"b"->2,"c"->3)
m1("a")
```

- [ ] a
- [ ] 2
- [ ] b
- [ ] 1
